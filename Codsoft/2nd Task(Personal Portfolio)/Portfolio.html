            <h3>Project 1 - Movie Recommendation System</h3>
            <p>For my recent project, I developed a Movie Recommendation System, leveraging the power of machine learning and collaborative filtering techniques. The system analyzes user preferences and behaviors to provide personalized movie suggestions, enhancing the overall user experience,Utilizing a vast dataset of movie ratings and user interactions, the recommendation system employs algorithms to identify patterns and similarities among users. By understanding individual preferences, the system intelligently suggests movies that align with a user's taste, fostering a more engaging and tailored content discovery process,The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the implementation of recommendation algorithms such as collaborative filtering. The user interface is designed for seamless interaction, allowing users to explore recommended movies and discover new favorites based on their unique interests.</p>

            <h3>Project 2 - Obstacle Avoiding Car</h3>
            <p>As part of my engineering journey, I undertook an exciting project involving the development of an Obstacle Avoiding Car. This autonomous vehicle is designed to navigate its environment intelligently, avoiding obstacles in its path using advanced sensor technologies,The car is equipped with ultrasonic sensors that allow it to detect obstacles in its vicinity. Using a combination of programming and control systems, the car can make real-time decisions to change its direction and maneuver around obstacles, ensuring a safe and obstacle-free journey,This project not only showcased my skills in robotics and programming but also emphasized the practical application of artificial intelligence in the realm of autonomous vehicles. The Obstacle Avoiding Car serves as a testament to my dedication to exploring innovative solutions and my commitment to bridging theoretical knowledge with hands-on, real-world projects.</p>
